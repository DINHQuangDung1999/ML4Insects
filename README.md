# ML4Insects
This is the project I'm currently working on, which will be frequently updated. I am mentored by Dr. Hy Truong Son (Indiana State University).

In this project, the data was EPG signals and the objective was to segment different waveforms. MLP models together with Fourier transforms work well but there are still room for developments.
